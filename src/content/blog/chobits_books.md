# Book 1: A City with No People

In this city...there are no people. <br>
The lights are on in all the houses. But there's nobody on the streets. <br>
Are there people inside? I peek in a window to find out. <br>
There are people. But they are with them. <br>
I look in other houses. These people are with them, too. <br>
This city is just like all the rest. <br>
Being with them is fun. More fun than being with people. <br>
Nobody comes outside anymore. There are no people in this city. <br>
I will leave this city and go to another one. <br>
I hope that I will meet someone. Someone just for me. <br>
But if that special someone falls in love with me... <br>
I will have to leave that someone. <br>
Even so, I want to meet that special someone. <br>
This is what I think as I leave the city with no people.

# Book 2: Someone Just for Me

Just as I feared...there's no one here either. <br>
Everyone is inside with them. <br>
Being with them is like living a beautiful dream. <br>
A beautiful dream that no one wants to wake up from. <br>
They will grant your deepest wishes. <br>
They will do whatever you ask. They will be whatever you want. <br>
They can do things that you cannot. <br>
But...there is one thing...they cannot do. <br>
They can never become people. <br>
They might look like people, but they are only substitutes. <br>
I know this very well because I am one of them. <br>
Today, I look for someone just for me. <br>
Someone who will love me even if I can't fulfill their wishes. <br>
Someone who has love for me alone. <br>
But... There is another me. <br>
The other me asks..."Does such a person exist?" <br>
I need...someone whose love for me is true. <br>
I want...someone who loves me without asking anything in exchange. <br>
I hope...unless that someone loves me for being me... <br>
...they're not someone just for me. <br>
Is this so? <br>
"It is." <br>
This someone exists? <br>
"He does." <br>
If so...then where? <br>
My someone is nearby, I think. Perhaps I already know him. <br>
"But..." <br>
"...what if that person does not love you back?" <br>
"What if that person likes someone...other than you?" <br>
"People aren't like them. You can't erase their feelings." <br>
"People aren't easy to change." <br>
I know. <br>
But people do change. Their feelings are dynamic. <br>
"Feelings of love are more resistant than others." <br>
"What if he never loves you?" <br>
Then I'll have to decide. <br>
Decide...and then do what must be done. <br>
Me and the other me. <br>

# Book 3: They Can Do Anything

They...can do anything. <br>
They are super-people made by people. <br>
They can be prettier than the real thing. <br>
They can be smarter than the real thing. <br>
They can be whatever people want them to be. <br>
Whatever people can dream of. <br>
When the people saw their creation, they thought that their dreams had come true. <br>
But then...people forgot their dreams. <br>
And in time, they invited people to share a new dream... <br>
...a dream they can't wake up from. <br>
But... <br>
Is that the dream that people want? Is that what happiness is? <br>
They...were created to make people happy. <br>
But...are people truly happy being with them? <br>
Is this city with no people truly happy? <br>
I don't know. Because... <br>
Happiness depends on the individual. <br>
All people are different. No two are the same. <br>
What makes one person happy...might make another sad. <br>
People's souls come in all shapes and sizes. <br>
And as time goes on and a person grows, their soul can change. <br>
Their hopes and dreams can change. <br>
That's why...there isn't just one type of happiness. <br>
Then... <br>
...there must be a way that I can be happy, too? <br>
That is what we all want, isn't it? <br>
To find the person just for you, to find your own happiness... <br>
...that would be wonderful, wouldn't it?

# Book 4: A Wish That Can't Be Granted

One day I went to a new city. <br>
They are in this city, too. <br>
There is no place without them anymore. <br>
The people are with them. <br>
There are as many of them as there are people. <br>
But... <br>
There is only one person just for me... <br>
...and I still have not found him. <br>
You are a person, aren't you? <br>
What was that? I should do what with my hand? <br>
Hold it out? <br>
Where are you taking me? <br>
Is this your house? Why did you bring me here? <br>
Are you... <br>
Are you... <br>
...the person just for me? <br>
You might be...but... <br>
Perhaps this person only brought me here... <br>
...because I am one of them. <br>
Maybe he's just like everyone else. Maybe he just wants me to grant his wishes. <br>
I'm not like the rest of them. There is one wish I cannot grant. <br>
For if I were to grant that wish, I would... <br>
...have to say goodbye forever to the someone just for me. <br>

# Book 5: Little By Little

Many days have passed since you... <br>
...brought me to this place. <br>
You still go outside, even when you have me. <br>
You experience many things outside. <br>
And then you come home and tell me about them. <br>
Sometimes you even take me outside. <br>
Even though I'm one of them. <br>
You tell me that I can do whatever I want with my things, as if we were equals. <br>
Little by little, the time with you and me passes. <br>
Little by little, this space becomes yours and mine. <br>
Little by little, the distance is moving. <br>
Yours and my distance. <br>
But has the distance between us gotten smaller? <br>
Or has it grown bigger? <br>
I don't know. <br>
I do know that I want it to be smaller. <br>
But then the same thing would happen again. <br>
"It won't be the same." <br>
"This person isn't that person." <br>
"It's someone else. People are all different." <br>
"Even if people look the same... <br>
"...they're all a little bit different." <br>
"No two hearts are exactly the same." <br>
"That's why the same thing won't happen." <br>
Then is that person the "someone just for me?" <br>
I don't know. <br>
But... <br>
...I'm starting to hope he is. <br>
In this place that this person brought me to... <br>
Little by little... <br>
...little by little... <br>
...I'm beginning to hope that... <br>
...I can start finding happiness. <br>
But... <br>
...someone will come to stop it. <br>
Someone will come to prevent me from finding the someone just for me. <br>
And... <br>
That person will take care of me. <br>
But it's not because I'm me. <br>
That person is kind. <br>
To all people and all of them... <br>
...he is kind. <br>
Right. <br>
That person is kind... <br>
...and probably not just towards me. <br>
But even if that person is kind to all, his kindness should be a little different each time. <br>
He can't be kind in the same way to everyone... <br>
...because that person is a person. <br>
That's right. <br>
A person's heart can't stay the same forever. <br>
A person's heart changes a little bit everyday... <br>
...because that is their nature. <br>
It can be different. <br>
It doesn't always have to be the same. <br>
If he... <br>
...finds in me the things that make me special. <br>
If he likes me because I am me. <br>
If that person... <br>
...takes the time to find what makes me different from the others... <br>
If he likes me because I am me... <br>
...if that happens... <br>
...we may be able to become something a little different from before. <br>
I may not have to lose what's most important to me... <br>
...like last time. <br>
What's most important... <br>
...what's most important to them and to people... <br>
...is something precious... <br>
...something you can't lose. <br>
The proof that I am who I am... <br>
...the special proof. <br>
That proof will tell me who my someone is. <br>
That special, special... <br>
..."someone just for me."
