# Book 1: A City with No People

In this city...there are no people. <br>
The lights are on in all the houses. But there's nobody on the streets. <br>
Are there people inside? I peek in a window to find out. <br>
There are people. But they are with them. <br>
I look in other houses. These people are with them, too. <br>
This city is just like all the rest. <br>
Being with them is fun. More fun than being with people. <br>
Nobody comes outside anymore. There are no people in this city. <br>
I will leave this city and go to another one. <br>
I hope that I will meet someone. Someone just for me. <br>
But if that special someone falls in love with me... <br>
I will have to leave that someone. <br>
Even so, I want to meet that special someone. <br>
This is what I think as I leave the city with no people.

# Book 2: Someone Just for Me

Just as I feared...there's no one here either. <br>
Everyone is inside with them. <br>
Being with them is like living a beautiful dream. <br>
A beautiful dream that no one wants to wake up from. <br>
They will grant your deepest wishes. <br>
They will do whatever you ask. They will be whatever you want. <br>
They can do things that you cannot. <br>
But...there is one thing...they cannot do. <br>
They can never become people. <br>
They might look like people, but they are only substitutes. <br>
I know this very well because I am one of them. <br>
Today, I look for someone just for me. <br>
Someone who will love me even if I can't fulfill their wishes. <br>
Someone who has love for me alone. <br>
But... There is another me. <br>
The other me asks..."Does such a person exist?" <br>
I need...someone whose love for me is true. <br>
I want...someone who loves me without asking anything in exchange. <br>
I hope...unless that someone loves me for being me... <br>
...they're not someone just for me. <br>
Is this so? <br>
"It is." <br>
This someone exists? <br>
"He does." <br>
If so...then where? <br>
My someone is nearby, I think. Perhaps I already know him. <br>
"But..." <br>
"...what if that person does not love you back?" <br>
"What if that person likes someone...other than you?" <br>
"People aren't like them. You can't erase their feelings." <br>
"People aren't easy to change." <br>
I know. <br>
But people do change. Their feelings are dynamic. <br>
"Feelings of love are more resistant than others." <br>
"What if he never loves you?" <br>
Then I'll have to decide. <br>
Decide...and then do what must be done. <br>
Me and the other me. <br>

# Book 3: They Can Do Anything

They...can do anything. <br>
They are super-people made by people. <br>
They can be prettier than the real thing. <br>
They can be smarter than the real thing. <br>
They can be whatever people want them to be. <br>
Whatever people can dream of. <br>
When the people saw their creation, they thought that their dreams had come true. <br>
But then...people forgot their dreams. <br>
And in time, they invited people to share a new dream... <br>
...a dream they can't wake up from. <br>
But... <br>
Is that the dream that people want? Is that what happiness is? <br>
They...were created to make people happy. <br>
But...are people truly happy being with them? <br>
Is this city with no people truly happy? <br>
I don't know. Because... <br>
Happiness depends on the individual. <br>
All people are different. No two are the same. <br>
What makes one person happy...might make another sad. <br>
People's souls come in all shapes and sizes. <br>
And as time goes on and a person grows, their soul can change. <br>
Their hopes and dreams can change. <br>
That's why...there isn't just one type of happiness. <br>
Then... <br>
...there must be a way that I can be happy, too? <br>
That is what we all want, isn't it? <br>
To find the person just for you, to find your own happiness... <br>
...that would be wonderful, wouldn't it?

# Book 4: A Wish That Can't Be Granted

One day I went to a new city. <br>
They are in this city, too. <br>
There is no place without them anymore. <br>
The people are with them. <br>
There are as many of them as there are people. <br>
But... <br>
There is only one person just for me... <br>
...and I still have not found him. <br>
You are a person, aren't you? <br>
What was that? I should do what with my hand? <br>
Hold it out? <br>
Where are you taking me? <br>
Is this your house? Why did you bring me here? <br>
Are you... <br>
Are you... <br>
...the person just for me? <br>
You might be...but... <br>
Perhaps this person only brought me here... <br>
...because I am one of them. <br>
Maybe he's just like everyone else. Maybe he just wants me to grant his wishes. <br>
I'm not like the rest of them. There is one wish I cannot grant. <br>
For if I were to grant that wish, I would... <br>
...have to say goodbye forever to the someone just for me. <br>
