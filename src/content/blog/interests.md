## programming

computer architectures is fun. it likes that. there are no jobs related to that so hopefully lumi won't last that long.

lumi hasn't programmed in a long time. used c for classes and rust for projects before.

- c++: writing  [meta stuff](https://github.com/lumikalt/ranges) is cool.
- rust: proudest code is an [emulator](https://github.com/lumikalt/scratchy) for risc-v asm.

sometimes interested in langdev, especially stack languages like uiua.

## public transit

trains are very cool. buses too. just any public transit topic will fascinate it, probably. stuck in portugal where trains suck and buses are...
well they're pretty okay actually. for those who live in city centers at least.

## reading

lumi spends a lot of its time reading, mostly sci-fi and fantasy. corrently reading discworld.

### books

- [children of time][childrenoftime] - the whole trilogy is awesome, even got a spider plushie due to this, named after the protags, portia.
- [the culture][culture] - player of games is the favorite thus far.
- [three body problem][threebody] - also the whole trilogy & the turned-official fanfic. that one solves some gaps and is lovely. Da Shi is the coolest.
- [discworld][discworld] - truly incredible, hilarious worldbuilding, with funny dialogue and characters.
- [a certain magical index][magicalindex] - incredibly well written magic/religion vs science setting, and the Misakas are so cool...
- [the irregular at magic highschool][mahouka] - single best magic system, imo. bland protag but high-tech magic is the best.

### web novels

- [no, i said it's mental immunity][mentalimmunity] - pastel is adorable and funny, big rolemodel.
- [seoul object story][seoulobjectstory] - pretty well written worldbuilding based on SCP, with adorable characters.
- [rose of the abyss][roseoftheabyss] - a cool little plant in love with a strong supportive woman...

## media

also likes watching some shows. [dark][dark], [the expanse][expanse], [for all mankind][forallmankind], all very good sci-fi.

not a big anime watcher, especially since it's extremely picky.
[dungeon meshi][dungeonmeshi] is really really cool, food is yummy. anime about food is unexpectedly good.
[charlotte][charlotte] has a sweet story, and incredible soundtrack, zhiend is awesome.

## games

gaming became mostly unenjoyable after depression. anyway, playing fortnite almost daily now to pass time.

still love the [littlebigplanet][lbp] games, especially karting, defo its favorite.
[locoroco 2][locoroco] on the psp is also a very fun game.
[xcom: eu/ew][xcom] is peak strategy. don't be ragebaited for missing the 98%s.
[baba is you][baba] is peak puzzling. haven't taken the time to play it fully tho.
[blue prince][blueprince] has incredible storytelling and truly grand puzzles.
