## programming

computer architectures is fun. it likes that. hopefully a future job related to that?? who knows, doubt tho. that job market is way competitive...

likes to program in c++ or rust, but has used many programming languages.

- c++: writing  [meta stuff](https://github.com/lumikalt/ranges) is adorable.
- rust: bestest lang. proudest code is an [emulator](https://github.com/lumikalt/scratchy) for risc-v asm.

quite interested in langdev sometimes, especially stack languages like Uiua, which is based on the best APL.

## food

it loves food, a lot. tho small stomach and thin, so can't rly eat much. in the future will try to become more of a cooker so it can make all the swwets it wants!!!

yummiest food is sweetsour pork, chinese style. tho it competes with carbonara pasta. cod fritters after those.

tho for favorite desserts it's without a doubt the lemon meringue pie.

## trains

trains r also very cool. buses too. just any public transit topic will fascinate it, probably. stuck in portugal where trains suck and buses are...
well they're pretty okay actually. for those who live in city centers at least.

## reading

other than that umm, lumi absolutely loves reading!, especially sci-fi and fantasy. it's been reading some web novels lately too, along with some ao3 fics.

### books

- [children of time][childrenoftime] - the whole trilogy is awesome! even got a spider plushie due to this. it got named after the protags, the Portia!!
- [the murderbot diaries][murderbot] - robot \<3 dislikes most people, relatable.
- [the culture][culture] - space commies, so cool! Player of Games is the favorite thus far.
- [three body problem][threebody] - also the whole trilogy & the turned-official fanfic. that one solves some gaps and is lovely. Da Shi is the coolest.
- [a certain magical index][magicalindex] - incredibly well written magic/religion vs science setting, and the Misakas are so cool,,,

### web novels

- [no, i said it's mental immunity][mentalimmunity] - pastel is adorable and funny, big rolemodel ;3
- [seoul object story][seoulobjectstory] - pretty well written worldbuilding based on SCP, with adorable characters.
- [rose of the abyss][roseoftheabyss] - a cool little plant in love with a strong supportive woman... waow.

### manga

- [gon][gon] - the last dino on earth :O... cool art and cute mute dino.
- [witch hat atelier][witchhatatelier] - the best!! manga there is. absolutely. incredibly well made magic setting and system.

## media

also likes watching some shows. [dark][dark], [the expanse][expanse], [for all mankind][forallmankind], all very good sci-fi.

for anime mhh,, not a big anime watcher, especially since it's extremely picky. there's [mahouka][mahouka] (good books too!) if the
watcher can ignore... the obvious thing. cuz otherwise it's absolutely perfect and it read all 32 lightnovels in a single month
because it's so good. [dungeon meshi][dungeonmeshi] is really really cool,, food is yummy. anime about food is unexpectedly good.

## games

videogames, huh. those stopped being fun a long time ago, it barely does it anymore. not a gamer. tho always happy to play any
of the [littlebigplanet][lbp] games!!! especially karting, defo its favorite.
[locoroco 2][locoroco] on the psp is also a very very very fun game.
[xcom: eu/ew][xcom] is peak strategy. don't miss too many 98%s :\).
[baba is you][baba] is peak puzzling, meanwhile. haven't taken the time to play it fully tho.
