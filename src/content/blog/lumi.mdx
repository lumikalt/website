hi

## about

<span class="about">a {age} yo <abbr title="yes, really." class="puppy">puppy</abbr>thing from portugal.</span>

trans girly, likes ***a*** woman. very needy and needs lots of physical affection. especially the kind you'd give to a puppy.

talks in 3rd person when comfy, sometimes. a bit childish and immature. don't treat it otherwise. definitively no honorifics or calling it a "woman" n such. can call it a girl.
same for adjectives, cute but no "handsome" and others.

best colors are baby blue, pink, lilac and orange.

sometimes programs. not as often anymore. stopped being enjoyable almost always.

not a gamer.

## interests

computer architectures is fun. it likes that. hopefully a future job related to that?? who knows, doubt tho.

it loves food, a lot. tho small stomach and thin, so can't rly eat much. in the future will try to become more of a cooker so it can make all the swwets it wants!!! if it deserves them,,,\
yummiest food is sweetsour pork, chinese style. tho it competes with carbonara pasta. cod fritters after those.\
tho for favorite desserts it's without a doubt the lemon meringue pie.

trains r also very cool. buses too. just any public transit topic will fascinate it, probably. stuck in portugal where trains suck and buses are...
well they're pretty okay actually. for those who live in city centers at least.

other than that umm, it loves reading sci-fi, here's a list:
- [children of time][childrenoftime] - the whole trilogy is awesome! even got a spider plushie from gf :3. it got named after the protag(s), the Portia!!
- [the murderbot diaries][murderbot] - robot \<3 dislikes most people, relatable.
- [three body problem][threebody] - also the whole trilogy & the turned-official fanfic. that one solves some gaps and is lovely. Da Shi is the coolest.
- [iron widow][ironwidow] - read this because of gf n it's rly cool. protag has fun nb moments. also positive polyam rep, how queer.

also likes watching some shows. gf making it watch [doctor who][drwho] (2005 reboot) and it adores the show!! [dark][dark], [the expanse][expanse],
[for all mankind][forallmankind], all very good sci-fi.

for anime mhh,, not a big anime watcher, especially since it's extremely picky. there's [mahouka][mahouka] if the watcher can ignore... the obvious thing.
cuz otherwise it's absolutely perfect and it read all 32 lightnovels in a single month because it's so good.
[psychopass][psychopass] is also very very very good. also also!! [dungeon meshi][dungeonmeshi] is really really cool,, food is yummy. anime about food is unexpectedly good.

videogames, huh. those stopped being fun a long time ago, it barely does it anymore. tho always happy to play any of the [littlebigplanet][lbp] games!!! especially karting, defo its favorite.
[locoroco 2][locoroco] on the psp is also a very very very fun game.
