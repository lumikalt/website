hi

## about

<span class="about">a {age} yo <abbr title="yes, really." class="puppy">puppy</abbr>thing from portugal. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è</span>

trans girly, likes ***a*** woman. very needy and needs lots of physical affection.


## interests

computer architectures is fun. it likes that. hopefully a future job related to that?? who knows, doubt tho.

it loves food, a lot. tho small stomach and thin, so can't rly eat much. in the future will try to become more of a cooker so it can make all the swwets it wants!!! if it deserves them,,,

trains r also very cool. buses too. just any public transit topic will fascinate it, probably. stuck in portugal where trains suck and buses are... well they're pretty okay actually. for those who live in city centers at least.

other than that umm, it loves reading sci-fi, here's a list:
- [children of time][children_of_time] - the whole trilogy is awesome! even got a spider plushie from gf :3. it got named after the protag, the Portia!!
- [the murderbot diaries][murderbot] - robot \<3 dislikes most people, relatable.
- [three body problem][threebody] - also the whole trilogy + the made-official fanfic. that one solves some gaps and is lovely. Da Shi is the coolest.
- [iron widow][ironwidow] - read this because of gf n its rly cool. protag has fun nb moments. also positive polyam rep, how queer.

also likes watching some shows. gf making me watch [doctor who][drwho] (2005 reboot) and it adores the show!! [dark][dark] is also very cool.

for anime mhh,, not a big anime watcher, especially since it's extremely picky. there's [mahouka][mahouka] if the watcher can ignore... the obvious thing.
[psychopass][psychopass] is also very very very good, also fits the theme of these interests. also also!! [dungeon meshi][dungeonmeshi] is really cool,, food is yummy.
