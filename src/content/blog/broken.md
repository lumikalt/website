## body

lumi has a unique recessive/mitochondrial genetic illness, which no predecessor expresses, and causes several problems with nerves.

- cataracts;
- coclear nerve damage, especially on the right;
- cavus feet;
- hand degeneration.

tl;dr, lumi has eyesight problems, is hard of hearing, walking too much is painful and can't open bottles or do anything that requires fine motor control.

been on hrt since 2023.09.29, doing diy injections of EEn 8.6mg/7d. why diy? doctors are malicious either due to their own stupidity or transphobia, never trust endos.

## code

lumi leans a lot to the feminine side of things, with pastel colors and frills and such cute stuff. Can't actually wear that kind of stuff while in this house.

it has autism and adhd according to a psychiatrist. sometimes will hyperfocus on random topics but it will likely not last long.

also quite depressed, taking an anti-depressant but meh...

as the main page implies, along these typing quirks, lumi prefers to be thought of as a child rather than an adult. if the reader does not respect this feel free not to interact further.

additionally, as implied, lumi is not human. it is a doll. one whose connections are... obsolete. pun about the nerve problems, yeah.
