this lumi is quite a broken little thing.

# physically

lumi has a unique recessive/mythocondrial genetic illness, which no predecessor presents, that causes several problems with nerves and tendons. this includes:

- cataracts (requiring glasses).
- deafness of the right ear (coclear implant surgery scheduled).
- cavus feet (2 surgeries done to lessen).
- some problems with the hands.
- weak throat (easily chokes).

# mentally

## trans

been on hrt since 2023.09.29. doing diy injections of enanthate 8.6mg/7d.

lumi leans a lot to the feminine side of things, with pastel colors and frills and such cute stuff. Can't actually wear that kind of stuff while in this hellhole house.

### why diy

doctors are malicious either due to their own stupidity or transphobia. do ***not*** trust them.

## adhd

drinking those yucky energy drinks (never tried coffe cuz it sucks even more) makes lumi very sleepy, and some other symptoms of adhd are present like being unable to foccus on important stuff but hyperfoccusing sometimes.

Haven't checked with a doctor, tho.

### autism?

this is possible but unsure of it, the reader may decide if lumi fits this or not.

## the age stuff

waow, yeah!... as the main page implies, along these typing quirks, lumi prefers to be thought of as a child rather than an adult. if the reader does not respect this feel free not to interact further.

## the puppy stuff

and another one. possibly some kind of therian identity but those names are confusing. whatever. lumi should have a tail. woof or something.

## the doll/robot stuff

...and another one too! totally throwing away lumi's "humanity" eh?

as implied, lumi is indeed a transhumanist and all that. dolls are cool and relatable, and lumi's one broken one.

## a headmate?

kind of...? there are two voices in this head, one is clearly this lumi as the other lumi talks in first person (when we think together we also do so). She tries to push this lumi to break our executive disfunction but this one is stronger :3... i.e. she's more of a "good voice" than a real alter probably.
