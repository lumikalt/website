## portuguese

lumi is a portuguese native, so writing in portuguese is pretty trivial, especially since it pays attention to the usual typos people make like "à" vs "há".

## spanish

because of knowing portuguese, learning spanish isn't very hard. however, lumi does lack quite a bit of knowledge, so it can pretty much only understand some written content, not produce any.

## english

been on the internet since it was 10 and started learning english in the 1st grade anyway, so lumi is pretty much at a native level, despite the accent when speaking, as that's uncommon. also due to lumi's pickiness, it rly tries to avoid typos and bad grammar.

## french

had french classes from the 5th to the 9th grade. it's fine... when lumi was in france and switzerland's french area it was able to read stuff in the groceries store since the employees didn't know english.

## korean, mandarin

tried to learn korean and mandarin during 2025 summer, but it was a short term hyperfocus, still got the documents lumi wrote with some grammar and vocabulary for the future.

## toki pona

decided to learn this. still can't always remember every word but getting there.

## luka pona

toki pona's sign language sibling. only learned a tiny bit as of now.
