## portuguese

lumi is a portuguese native, so writing in portuguese is pretty trivial, especially since it pays attention to the usual typos people make like "à" vs "há".

## spanish

because of knowing portuguese, learning spanish isn't very hard. however, lumi does lack quite a bit of knowledge, so it can pretty much only understand some written content, not produce any.

## english

been on the internet since it was 10 and started learning english in the 1st grade anyway, so lumi is pretty much at a native level, despite the accent when speaking, as that's uncommon. also due to lumi's pickiness, it rly tries to avoid typos and bad grammar.

## french

had french classes from the 5th to the 9th grade. it's fine... when lumi was in france and switzerland's french area it was able to read stuff in the groceries store since the employees didn't know english.

## korean

lumi's trying to learn some korean to read web novels straight from their raws. the reader might've noticed the web novels section of the interests page has some.

안녕! 이건 루미야.
