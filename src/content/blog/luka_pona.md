## why?

lumi is hard of hearing. also, portugal's LGP (língua gestual portuguesa / portuguese sign language) is paywalled, which is annoying when one wants to study by themselves at home.

## lesson 1

there are 9 hand shapes:

- pointy (only one or two fingers pointing outwards):
  - indicator: wan
  - indicator and middle: tu
  - indicator and thumb: tawa (note: tawa also requires moving the hand)
- round
  - thumbs up: kiwen
  - o with all fingers: sike
  - o with only thumb and indicator: lili
- paddle
  - flat: supa
  - 90º angle: nena
  - open: telo

and there are 8 hand placements:

1. head
2. eye
3. ear/shoulder
4. mouth
5. chest/stomach
6. shoulder
7. hand/neck
8. neutral space

the hand and fingers can be oriented in 5 ways:

1. out
2. in
3. up
4. down
5. side

and the set can be moved in 13 ways (too hard to explain them by text).

additionally, 2 non manual features exist. question NMF, where one raises their eyebrows and brings their head forwards; negative NMF, where one shakes their head or frowns.

most signs have:

- 1 strict handshape
- +1 strict parameter
- +3 flexible parameters

some others have more strict parameters.

examples:

- pona: 2 strict
- akesi: 3 strict
- jan: 4 strict
