## why?

lumi is hard of hearing. also, portugal's LGP (língua gestual portuguesa / portuguese sign language) is paywalled, which is annoying when one wants to study by themselves at home.

## parameters

there are 9 hand shapes:

- pointy (only one or two fingers pointing outwards):
  - indicator: wan
  - indicator and middle: tu
  - indicator and thumb: tawa (note: tawa also requires moving the hand)
- round
  - thumbs up: kiwen
  - o with all fingers: sike
  - o with only thumb and indicator: lili
- paddle
  - flat: supa
  - 90º angle: nena
  - open: telo

and there are 8 hand placements:

1. head
2. eye
3. ear/shoulder
4. mouth
5. chest/stomach
6. shoulder
7. hand/neck
8. neutral space

the hand and fingers can be oriented in 5 ways:

1. out
2. in
3. up
4. down
5. side

and the set can be moved in 13 ways (too hard to explain them by text).

additionally, 2 non manual features exist. question NMF, where one raises their eyebrows and brings their head forwards; negative NMF, where one shakes their head or frowns.

most signs have:

- 1 strict handshape
- +1 strict parameter
- +3 flexible parameters

some others have more strict parameters.

examples:

- pona: 2 strict
- akesi: 3 strict
- jan: 4 strict

1 handed spelling:

- vowels
  - a: thumbs up to the side
  - e: 90º paddle
  - i: indicator up
  - o: o with all fingers
  - u: indicator and middle together upwards
- consonants
  - w: indicator, middle and ring upwards, thumb and pinky together
  - j: indicator and middle together, sway like the letter shape
  - p: all up except the thumb
  - l: L shape upwards
  - k: sideways peace sign
  - n: upside-down peace sign
  - m: upside-down p
  - t: finger-gun downwards
  - s: open paddle

2 handed spelling: (TODO, doesn't matter much to lumi)

also, plural is expressed by specific movements, or using 2 hands.

## grammar

### pronouns

index finger points to the subject/object.
ni points down for this, away for that.

### subject-verb and subject-modifier

ni-N are ni pointing away, and all ni-N in a sentence point in consistent - but different for different numbers - directions.

it can be used for 3 grammatical constructs:

1. A does B - verb \
  jan ni-1 moku \
  the person eats.

2. A is B - adjective \
  jan ni-1 suli ni-1 \
  the person is tall.

3. A is a B - copula \
  jan ni-1 soweli ni-1 \
  humans are animals.

notice that the ni-1 at the end is optional, and works for emphasis or disambiguation.

however, if the hand shape is wan (indicator only), ni-1 is omitted. this is because LP does not use li, unlike TP. also, direction is important, and so is flow, which ni-1 preserves, unlike a specific particle. if it would break flow, we drop it - "economy of motion".

A B: mi moku - i eat, sina suli - you are tall, uta suli uta - the mouth is big

examples:

1. animals are important \
  soweli ni-1 suli ni-1

2. he is little \
  ona lili ona

3. i'm good \
  mi pona mi

for modifiers, we simply add them after the name: waso laso suli - big blue bird.

however, if we want to modify a modifier, we use pi: waso laso pi wawa suli - very powerful blue bird.

pi can also be replaced by a short stop: waso laso \_ wawa suli - very powerful blue bird.

### coverbs

a coverb is a secondary verb used with a main verb or a ni-1 adjective.

there are 5:

- tawa
- lon
- tan
- kepeken
- sama

they are signed in the format A V _ B Co-V or B Co-V _ A V.

examples:

- mi pali _ tomo mi __lon__
