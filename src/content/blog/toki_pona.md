## chapter 3

tokiponization.

### writing system

the alphabet has 14 letters:
aeijklmnopstuw

spellings are as expected except /j/ is a y sound.

every syllable has the following form:

- 10 onsets - 9 consonants or none
- 5 nuclei - 5 vowels
- 2 codas - /n/ or none

additionally, there are some more rules:

- the first syllable of the word is always the stressed one.
- /j/ cannot appear before /i/. \*/ji jin/ do not exist.
- /w/ cannot appear before rounded vowels. \*/wu wun wo won/ do not exist.
- /t/ cannot appear before /i/. \*/ti tin/ do not exist.
- only the first syllable of a word can start without a consonant, there are no vowel chains.
- /n/ cannot appear before another nasal consonant */n m/ in the same word.

hence, 92 real possible syllables with some restrictions.

### grammar

proper names are adjectives, not nouns.

for the imperative, li gets replaced with o if there's a subject, otherwise it goes before the verb.

for the vocative, o goes after the subject

## chapter 4

questions.

### grammar

a content word is something on its own, rather than a particle.

seme takes the place of any content word in a sentence to ask a question.
seme as a verb can replace a generic question, so "sina seme" can mean "what are you doing ?" (lit. you what?).

anu works like or to separate two equivalent content words that fill the same grammatical role within the sentence.

### dictionary

  - pron. what, which (interrogative pronoun)

- pilin
  - v. feel (emotional), experience an emotion; feel (physical), touch
  - n. feeling, emotion; sensation; heart

- jo
  - v. have, possess, hold; include, contain

- suwi
  - n. sweet, sugar, candy, desert
  - adj. sweet, cute, gentle

- nasa
  - adj. strange, unusual; silly, drunk

- anu
  - (particle) or

- kili
  - n. fruit, vegetable

- kasi
  - n. plant, vegetation

- pan
  - n. grain, wheat, barley, rice; grain-based food, bread, pasta

- kiwen

  - adj. solid, hard (texture)

- palisa
